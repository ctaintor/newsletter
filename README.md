# Newsletter

This project's goal is to allow all engineers in Klarna's TLV office to share knowledge between them in a way that most people feel comfortable.

 - **Send an email written in Markdown**. Because Markdown is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!
   
 - **Receive a newsletter once a week with an aggregated collection of posts**. Who doesn't like inbox-zero??
